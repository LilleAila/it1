        I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as
        Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it,
        GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather
        another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by
        the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising
        a full OS as defined by POSIX.
      </p>

        Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,
        without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of
        GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its
        users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by
        the GNU Project.
      </p>

        There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a
        part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the
        system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that
        you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but
        useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete
        operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU
        operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or
        GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really
        distributions of GNU/Linux!
